# portapack-HAVOC

HAVOC is a fork of the PortaPack H1 firmware, a portability add-on for the [HackRF One software-defined radio](http://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/).

As its name implies, HAVOC is a firmware aimed towards serious fun, mainly involving French systems (for now).
Don't use it, we never did.

Fork features:
* RDS (Radio Data System) basic group forming and transmit
* LCR (Language de Commande Routier) basic message forming and transmit
* Xylos transmitter, urban lighting control (NFM CCIR tones)
* Fully configurable AFSK transmit
* Fully configurable Jammer
* "Play Dead" in case of emergency
* Dynamic baseband code loading (see [wiki](https://github.com/furrtek/portapack-havoc/wiki))

Todo (highest to lowest priority):
* Frequency manager
* Wireless microphone transmit
* CTCSS talkie transmit
* Play wave files from ÂµSD
* Whistle (tone generator)
* EPAR transmit (old Xylos)
* Detect/decode/play/replay OOK from PT2262 and friends (doorbells, cheap remotes... )
* Make SIGFOX interceptor work with all modules
* Moltonel (tone detector/scanner)
* AFSK receiver
* Rolling-code jam and replay trick

**Visit the [wiki](https://github.com/furrtek/portapack-havoc/wiki) for more details.**

Hardware is available at [ShareBrained Technology](http://sharebrained.com/portapack).
