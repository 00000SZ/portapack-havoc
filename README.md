# portapack-HAVOC

The PortaPack H1 makes the [HackRF One software-defined radio](http://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/) portable. It adds an LCD touchscreen, user interface navigation controls, audio output and input, micro SD card slot, and real-time clock battery backup.

As it name implies, HAVOC is a firmware aimed towards serious fun. Don't use it. In fact, we never did.

Fork features:
* RDS (Radio Data System) basic group forming and transmit
* LCR (Language de Commande Routier) basic message forming
* Fully configurable AFSK transmit
* "Play Dead" in case of emergency

Todo:
* AFSK receiver
* Moltonel (tone detector/scanner)
* Whistle (tone generator)
* Signal drowner (jammer)
* Wireless microphone transmit
* CTCSS talkie transmit
* Play wave files from ÂµSD
* EPAR/Xylos transmit (French public lighting control)
* Detect/decode/play/replay PT2262 and friends (doorbells, cheap remotes... )
